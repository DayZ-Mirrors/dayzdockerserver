## Install

5 files are required to run the mod. Two are map-specific and the rest are common to all maps. They are:

* `cfgeventgroups.xml` - This is map-specific. The one included in this repository is for Chernarus.
* `cfgeventspawns.xml` - Same as above.
* `cfgspawnabletypes.xml` - Common to all maps.
* `events.xml` - Common to all maps.
* `types.xml` - Common to all maps.

The `start.sh` script is for doing extra stuff, but programatically. See the comments within it for details.
